Hi, I am Tymofii. I study CS with a major in AI at Charles University. I am also combining it with full-time work as an F# (and sometimes C#) Software Engineer at Barclays Investment Bank, where I work on financial infrastructure and market risk. I am generally interested in many areas across CS (in no particular order): AI (both as a black box, i.e., applications of LLMs in programming languages, and inner workings), traditional ML, distributed systems, systems programming, and functional programming. Here, I sometimes drop notes from things I read/watch and write articles about things I care about.
